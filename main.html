            Inception is a science fiction thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. The story follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who steals secrets from within the subconscious during the dream state. He is given a chance to have his criminal history erased if he can perform the nearly impossible task of "inception" — planting an idea in someone's mind.
